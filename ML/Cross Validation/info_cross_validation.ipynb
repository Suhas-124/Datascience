    "\n",
    "Cross-validation is a **technique used to evaluate the performance of a machine learning model** by splitting the data into **training** and **validation sets multiple times**. It ensures that the model performs well on **unseen data** and helps detect **overfitting** or **underfitting**.\n",
    "\n",
    "In simpler terms:\n",
    "- It‚Äôs like testing students on multiple question papers to ensure they‚Äôve understood the topic well, rather than just one paper.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### üõ†Ô∏è **Why Use Cross-Validation?**\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Prevents Overfitting:** Ensures the model doesn‚Äôt perform well on the training data only but also on unseen data.\n",
    "- **Reliable Performance Metrics:** Provides a better estimate of the model‚Äôs performance compared to a single train-test split.\n",
    "- **Efficient Use of Data:** Makes the most out of the available dataset by using every data point for both training and validation.\n",

    "\n",
    "#### 1Ô∏è‚É£ **Holdout Method (Simple Train-Test Split)**\n",
    "\n",
    "- The dataset is split into **training** and **test sets**.\n",
    "- **Example:** 80% for training, 20% for testing.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Pros:**  \n",
    "- Quick and easy.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Cons:**  \n",
    "- Performance can vary depending on the split.  \n",

    "#### 2Ô∏è‚É£ **K-Fold Cross-Validation**\n",
    "\n",
    "- The dataset is split into **K equal-sized folds** (subsets).\n",
    "- The model is trained on **K-1 folds** and validated on the **remaining fold**.\n",
    "- This process is repeated **K times**, with each fold used as a validation set once.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Example:**  \n",
    "For **5-Fold Cross-Validation**:\n",
    "- Split data into 5 folds.\n",
    "- Train on 4 folds, validate on the remaining fold.\n",
    "- Repeat the process 5 times.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Pros:**  \n",
    "- More reliable and less biased.  \n",
    "- Uses the entire dataset for both training and validation.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Cons:**  \n",
    "- Computationally expensive for large datasets.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 3Ô∏è‚É£ **Stratified K-Fold Cross-Validation**\n",
    "\n",
    "- Similar to K-Fold but **ensures each fold has a similar distribution of target labels** (especially useful for imbalanced datasets).\n",
    "\n",
    "**Use Case:**  \n",
    "When you have **imbalanced classes** (e.g., 90% Class A, 10% Class B).\n",

    "\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 4Ô∏è‚É£ **Leave-One-Out Cross-Validation (LOOCV)**\n",
    "\n",
    "- Each data point is used as a **validation set** once, while the rest are used for training.\n",
    "- For a dataset with **N data points**, LOOCV will run **N times**.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Pros:**  \n",
    "- Uses maximum data for training.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Cons:**  \n",
    "- **Extremely slow** for large datasets.\n",
