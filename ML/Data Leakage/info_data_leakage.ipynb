    "\n",
    "## 🧩 **1. What is Data Leakage?**\n",
    "\n",
    "**Data Leakage** happens when **information from outside the training dataset** is **used to create the model**. This leads to **overly optimistic model performance** during training but results in **poor performance** when the model is tested on new, unseen data.\n",
    "\n",
    "Think of it like **cheating on an exam** — if a student gets the answer key before the test, they’ll score high in the test but fail when tested in real life.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## 🔍 **2. Types of Data Leakage**\n",
    "\n",
    "There are two main types of data leakage:\n",
    "\n",
    "### 🔴 **A. Target Leakage (Label Leakage)**\n",
    "- Happens when **your model has access to information about the target variable (label)** during training that it wouldn’t normally have during prediction.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Example**:\n",
    "- Predicting whether a customer will default on a loan using the `defaulted` column in the dataset.  \n",
    "  If the `defaulted` column is already included in the training data, the model will learn to directly use it, which is cheating.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### 🔵 **B. Train-Test Contamination**\n",
    "- Happens when **information from the test set leaks into the training set**.  \n",
    "  This can occur if the data is **not properly split into training and testing sets** before preprocessing or feature engineering.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Example**:\n",
    "- You normalize the entire dataset before splitting it into training and test sets.  \n",
    "  This causes the test data to influence the training process, resulting in leakage.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## ⚠️ **3. Why is Data Leakage Dangerous?**\n",
    "\n",
    "- Your model will **perform very well on training data** but will **fail on unseen data**.\n",
    "- You may think your model is **accurate**, but it's actually **overfitted** due to leaked data.\n",
    "- It leads to **incorrect business decisions**.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## 🧪 **4. How to Identify Data Leakage?**\n",
    "\n",
    "Here’s how to spot potential leakage:\n",
    "\n",
    "### ✅ **Check Correlation with Target Variable**\n",
    "- If a feature has a **very high correlation** with the target variable (like 0.95 or higher), it could be a sign of leakage.\n",
    "\n",
    "### ✅ **Check for Impossible Features**\n",
    "- Look for **features that wouldn’t be available at prediction time**.  \n",
    "  For example, using **future data** to predict something in the past is leakage.\n",
    "\n",
    "### ✅ **Unexpectedly High Model Accuracy**\n",
    "- If your model’s accuracy is **too good to be true**, double-check your data preprocessing steps.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## 🛡️ **5. How to Prevent Data Leakage?**\n",
    "\n",
    "Here’s a **step-by-step guide** to avoid data leakage:\n",
    "\n",
    "### 📌 **Step 1: Split Your Data First (Before Preprocessing)**\n",
    "- Always split your data into **training and test sets** **before** performing any preprocessing (e.g., scaling, encoding).\n",
    "\n",
    "❌ Wrong:\n",
    "```python\n",
    "# Wrong: Preprocessing before splitting the data\n",
    "from sklearn.preprocessing import StandardScaler\n",
    "scaler = StandardScaler()\n",
    "data_scaled = scaler.fit_transform(data)\n",
    "\n",
    "train, test = train_test_split(data_scaled, test_size=0.2)\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "✅ Correct:\n",
    "```python\n",
    "# Correct: Splitting before preprocessing\n",
    "from sklearn.model_selection import train_test_split\n",
    "train, test = train_test_split(data, test_size=0.2)\n",
    "\n",
    "from sklearn.preprocessing import StandardScaler\n",
    "scaler = StandardScaler()\n",
    "train_scaled = scaler.fit_transform(train)\n",
    "test_scaled = scaler.transform(test)\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### 📌 **Step 2: Be Careful with Target Columns**\n",
    "- **Do not use future data** or **target values** when creating features.\n",
    "\n",
    "❌ Wrong:\n",
    "```python\n",
    "# Wrong: Using the target variable in feature engineering\n",
    "data['future_sales'] = data['sales'].shift(-1)\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "✅ Correct:\n",
    "```python\n",
    "# Correct: Only use past data to predict future values\n",
    "data['past_sales'] = data['sales'].shift(1)\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### 📌 **Step 3: Use Pipelines for Preprocessing**\n",
    "- Use **scikit-learn pipelines** to ensure **preprocessing happens separately** for training and test data.\n",
    "\n",
    "✅ Example using a pipeline:\n",
    "```python\n",
    "from sklearn.pipeline import Pipeline\n",
    "from sklearn.preprocessing import StandardScaler\n",
    "from sklearn.linear_model import LogisticRegression\n",
    "\n",
    "pipeline = Pipeline([\n",
    "    ('scaler', StandardScaler()),\n",
    "    ('model', LogisticRegression())\n",
    "])\n",
    "\n",
    "pipeline.fit(X_train, y_train)\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### 📌 **Step 4: Avoid Using Data that Won’t Be Available at Prediction Time**\n",
    "- Ask yourself: **Will I have this information when making predictions?**\n",
    "\n",
    "❌ Wrong:\n",
    "- Using a **feature that is generated after the event** (like **revenue after a sale**) to predict whether a customer will buy.\n",
    "\n",
    "✅ Correct:\n",
    "- Use **customer behavior before the sale** to predict the likelihood of purchase.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### 📌 **Step 5: Validate with Cross-Validation**\n",
    "- Use **cross-validation** to ensure your model isn’t leaking data.\n",
    "\n",
    "✅ Example:\n",
    "```python\n",
    "from sklearn.model_selection import cross_val_score\n",
    "scores = cross_val_score(model, X, y, cv=5)\n",
    "```\n",

    "\n",
    "## 🎯 **What is Data Leakage? (Layman Explanation)**\n",
    "\n",
    "Imagine you're preparing for an **exam**, and you accidentally see **some answers** from the answer sheet **before the test**.\n",
    "\n",
    "When you take the test:\n",
    "- You’ll get **very high marks**, because you’ve already seen some answers.  \n",
    "- But in **real life**, when you’re asked the same questions without help, you’ll **fail miserably**.\n",
    "\n",
    "**That’s what Data Leakage is!**  \n",
    "Your machine learning model **\"cheats\" by seeing answers in advance** during training, so it **performs very well on the training data** but **fails badly on new, unseen data**.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## 🚨 **Why is Data Leakage Bad?**\n",
    "\n",
    "If your model cheats (due to leakage):\n",
    "- It gives you **fake confidence** that it’s performing well.\n",
    "- But in reality, when the model is deployed to predict new data, it **fails badly**.\n",
    "  \n",
    "It’s like a student getting **top grades** in a cheating-based exam but **failing in a job interview** because they never really learned the subject.\n",

    "\n",
    "Let’s look at some **real-life examples of data leakage** and why they’re bad.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### 🛒 **Example 1: Predicting Customer Purchases (Target Leakage)**\n",
    "\n",
    "Suppose you’re building a model to **predict whether a customer will buy a product**.  \n",
    "Your data has a column called **\"Purchased\"**, which tells whether they bought the product or not.\n",
    "\n",
    "If your model **sees the \"Purchased\" column during training**, it’ll **use that information** to make predictions.\n",
    "\n",
    "🤯 **But wait! That’s cheating!**  \n",
    "Because **\"Purchased\" is what you’re trying to predict** in the first place!\n",
    "\n",
    "This is **target leakage**.  \n",
    "The model already knows the outcome, so it’s **not actually learning anything**.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### 🏥 **Example 2: Predicting Disease Diagnosis (Target Leakage)**\n",
    "\n",
    "You’re building a model to predict whether a patient has a disease.\n",
    "\n",
    "Your data has a column called **\"Test Result\"**, which shows the result of a medical test taken **after the diagnosis**.\n",
    "\n",
    "🤔 **Problem:**  \n",
    "When you deploy the model, you won’t have the test result before the diagnosis!  \n",
    "So your model is **using future information** that **won’t be available in real life**.\n",
    "\n",
    "This is another example of **data leakage**.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### 🧪 **Example 3: Scaling Data Before Splitting (Train-Test Contamination)**\n",
    "\n",
    "Imagine you’re building a house.  \n",
    "Would you **measure all the bricks together first**, and then decide which bricks to use for the foundation and walls?  \n",

    "## 💡 **How to Spot Data Leakage? (Simple Tricks)**\n",
    "\n",
    "Here’s how to catch leakage before it messes up your model:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Too Good to Be True?**  \n",
    "   - If your model’s accuracy is **very high** (like 95-99%), it’s probably cheating.  \n",
    "   - Real-world models usually have **reasonable accuracy** (70-90%).\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Look at Feature Correlations**  \n",
    "   - Check if any feature has a **very high correlation with the target (0.9 or more)**.  \n",
    "   - That’s a red flag — it means the feature is leaking target information.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## 🚦 **What Happens If You Don't Fix Data Leakage?**\n",
    "\n",
    "Your model will:\n",
    "- **Work well during training.**  \n",
    "- **Fail in real-world scenarios.**\n",
    "\n",
    "For example:\n",
    "- Imagine a fraud detection model that catches **100% of frauds** during testing.  \n",
    "- But when deployed, it catches **almost no frauds** because it relied on leaked information.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## 🔧 **Quick Fixes to Prevent Data Leakage**\n",
    "\n",
    "Here are **3 simple steps** to prevent leakage:\n",
    "\n",
    "### ✅ **Step 1: Split Data First**\n",
    "Before you do **any preprocessing** (like scaling, encoding, etc.), split your data into **training and test sets**.\n",
    "\n",
    "✅ Correct:\n",
    "```python\n",
    "from sklearn.model_selection import train_test_split\n",
    "\n",
    "# Split data first\n",
    "X_train, X_test, y_train, y_test = train_test_split(X, y, test_size=0.2)\n",
    "\n",
    "# Then apply preprocessing\n",
    "from sklearn.preprocessing import StandardScaler\n",
    "scaler = StandardScaler()\n",
    "X_train_scaled = scaler.fit_transform(X_train)\n",
    "X_test_scaled = scaler.transform(X_test)\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### ✅ **Step 2: Use Pipelines**\n",
    "Using **pipelines** ensures that **data preprocessing** is done separately for training and test sets.\n",
    "\n",
    "✅ Example:\n",
    "```python\n",
    "from sklearn.pipeline import Pipeline\n",
    "from sklearn.preprocessing import StandardScaler\n",
    "from sklearn.linear_model import LogisticRegression\n",
    "\n",
    "# Create a pipeline\n",
    "pipeline = Pipeline([\n",
    "    ('scaler', StandardScaler()),\n",
    "    ('classifier', LogisticRegression())\n",
    "])\n",
    "\n",
    "# Fit the pipeline\n",
    "pipeline.fit(X_train, y_train)\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### ✅ **Step 3: Think Like a Predictor**\n",
    "When adding features to your model, ask yourself:\n",
    "\n",
    "💭 **“Will I have this information at prediction time?”**\n",
    "\n",
    "- If the answer is **No**, **don’t use that feature**.  \n",
    "- If the answer is **Yes**, then it’s safe to use.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## 🧑‍💻 **Example Code to Spot Data Leakage**\n",
    "\n",
    "Here’s a quick Python snippet to check for **high correlations** (a sign of leakage):\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "import pandas as pd\n",
    "\n",
    "# Calculate correlations\n",
    "correlation_matrix = df.corr()\n",
    "\n",
    "# Find features with high correlation with target\n",
    "target_correlation = correlation_matrix['target'].sort_values(ascending=False)\n",
    "\n",
    "# Print features with correlation > 0.8\n",
    "print(target_correlation[target_correlation > 0.8])\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## 🤯 **Final Takeaway:**\n",
    "\n",
    "In **simple words**:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Data Leakage is like cheating on an exam.**  \n",
    "- Your model will perform well during training but fail in real life.  \n",
    "- Always split your data first and think about whether a feature will be available at prediction time.\n",
