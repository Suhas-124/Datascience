    "### **What is Probability?**  \n",
    "Probability is all about **how likely something is to happen.** It's the chance of an event occurring. For example:  \n",
    "- **Sunny day tomorrow?** 🌞 Maybe 80% chance.  \n",
    "- **Winning a lottery?** 🎟️ Very low probability!  \n",
    "\n",
    "Probability is expressed as a number between **0** (impossible) and **1** (certain).  \n",
    "👉 Example: If you toss a coin, the probability of getting heads is **0.5** or **50%**.  \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### **Basic Terms** 📝  \n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Random Experiment** 🎲  \n",
    "   An action or process where the outcome is uncertain.  \n",
    "   - Example: Tossing a coin, rolling a dice, picking a card.  \n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Trial** 🔄  \n",
    "   Each attempt of the random experiment.  \n",
    "   - Example: Each time you toss the coin is a trial.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Outcome** 🎯  \n",
    "   The result of a trial.  \n",
    "   - Example: When you roll a dice, possible outcomes are **1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6**.  \n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Sample Space** 📋  \n",
    "   The set of all possible outcomes of a random experiment.  \n",
    "   - Example: For tossing a coin, the sample space is **{Heads, Tails}**.  \n",
    "\n",
    "5. **Event** 🎉  \n",
    "   A specific result or group of results you’re interested in.  \n",
    "   - Example: Rolling an even number on a dice is an event: **{2, 4, 6}**.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### **Types of Events**  \n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Simple Event** 💎  \n",
    "   An event with a single outcome.  \n",
    "   - Example: Rolling a 5 on a dice.  \n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Compound Event** 🧩  \n",
    "   An event with multiple outcomes.  \n",
    "   - Example: Rolling an even number on a dice **{2, 4, 6}**.  \n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Mutually Exclusive Events** 🚫  \n",
    "   Two events that cannot happen at the same time.  \n",
    "   - Example: Getting heads **and** tails in a single coin toss.  \n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Independent Events** 🤝  \n",
    "   One event doesn’t affect the other.  \n",
    "   - Example: Tossing two coins; the result of one doesn’t impact the other.  \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### **Empirical Probability vs. Theoretical Probability**  \n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Empirical Probability** 📊  \n",
    "   Based on actual experiments or past data.  \n",
    "   - Formula: **P(E) = (Number of times event occurred) ÷ (Total trials)**  \n",
    "   - Example: If you tossed a coin 100 times and got 60 heads, the probability of heads = **60/100 = 0.6**.  \n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Theoretical Probability** 📐  \n",
    "   Based on reasoning or math, not experiments.  \n",
    "   - Formula: **P(E) = (Favorable outcomes) ÷ (Total outcomes)**  \n",
    "   - Example: Probability of rolling a 3 on a dice = **1/6**, as there’s only one 3 on a dice.  \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### **Quick Fun Examples** 🎉  \n",
    "1. What’s the probability of drawing a red card from a deck of cards?  \n",
    "   - Total cards = 52  \n",
    "   - Red cards = 26  \n",
    "   - Probability = **26/52 = 1/2 = 50%**.  \n",
    "\n",
    "2. If it rained 20 out of the last 30 days 🌧️:  \n",
    "   - Empirical Probability of rain = **20/30 = 2/3 ≈ 0.67 (67%)**.  \n",
    "\n",

    "### **What is a Random Variable?** 🎯  \n",
    "\n",
    "A **Random Variable** is just a way to assign numbers to outcomes of a random experiment. Think of it as a label or a value we give to what happens.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Example: Tossing a coin\n",
    "- If **Heads = 1** and **Tails = 0**, then the random variable represents the outcome numerically.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Two Types of Random Variables:  \n",
    "1. **Discrete Random Variable** 🎟️  \n",
    "   - It can take **specific values only** (like 0, 1, 2, etc.).  \n",
    "   - Example: Number of goals scored in a match (0, 1, 2...).\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Continuous Random Variable** 📈  \n",
    "   - It can take **any value** in a range.  \n",
    "   - Example: Temperature in Chennai tomorrow (30.2°C, 31.8°C).\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### **Probability Distribution of a Random Variable** 🌈  \n",
    "\n",
    "This is like a map that tells you how likely each value of the random variable is. It assigns probabilities to each possible value.  \n",
    "\n",
    "#### Example: Rolling a dice 🎲  \n",
    "- Random Variable $ X $: The number on the dice.  \n",
    "- Probability Distribution:  \n",

    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### **Mean of a Random Variable** 📊  \n",
    "\n",
    "The **mean** (or expected value) is the average value you’d get if you repeated the experiment **many times**. It tells you the **center** of the distribution.  \n",
    "\n",
    "#### Formula:  \n",
    "$$\n",
    "E(X) = \\text{Sum of (Value × Probability for all outcomes)}  \n",

    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### **Variance of a Random Variable** 📐  \n",
    "\n",
    "Variance measures how **spread out** the values are around the mean. If the variance is small, the values are close to the mean; if large, they’re more spread out.  \n",

    "$$\n",
    "\\text{Variance (Var(X))} = E(X^2) - [E(X)]^2  \n",

    "- $ E(X^2) = \\frac{1^2}{6} + \\frac{2^2}{6} + ... + \\frac{6^2}{6} = 15.17 $.  \n",

    "### **📜 What is Bayes' Theorem?**\n",
    "Bayes' Theorem is a **probability formula** that updates our beliefs about an event **based on new evidence**. It’s named after **Thomas Bayes** and is foundational in statistics, machine learning, and decision-making.\n",

    "**Formula**:\n",
    "$$\n",
