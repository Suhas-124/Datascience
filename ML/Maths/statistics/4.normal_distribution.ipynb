    "### 1Ô∏è‚É£ **Symmetry**\n",
    "The normal distribution is perfectly **symmetric** around its **mean**. This means that the left side of the curve is a mirror image of the right side.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Mean = Median = Mode**  \n",
    "In a normal distribution, the **mean** (average), **median** (middle value), and **mode** (most frequent value) are all the same.  \n",

    "- It ensures that half of the data lies **to the left** of the mean and the other half lies **to the right**.\n",

    "- The **tails** of the bell extend infinitely in both directions but never touch the x-axis (this is called the **asymptotic property**).\n",

    "### 3Ô∏è‚É£ **Mean and Standard Deviation Define the Curve**\n",
    "The normal distribution is uniquely defined by two parameters:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Mean (¬µ)**  \n",
    "   - Determines the **location** of the center of the curve.\n",
    "   - Shifts the curve **left or right** on the x-axis.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Standard Deviation (œÉ)**  \n",
    "   - Determines the **spread** or **width** of the curve.\n",
    "   - A **smaller œÉ** means the curve is **narrower** and **taller**.\n",
    "   - A **larger œÉ** means the curve is **wider** and **shorter**.\n",
