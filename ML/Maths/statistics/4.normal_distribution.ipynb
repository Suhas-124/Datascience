    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## 🔎 **What is Normal Distribution?**\n",
    "\n",
    "The **Normal Distribution** shows how data points tend to cluster around the **mean (average)** value.\n",

    "### 🛠️ **Characteristics of Normal Distribution:**\n",
    "1. **Bell-shaped curve** (symmetric).\n",
    "2. **Mean = Median = Mode** (all are the same).\n",

    "5. It follows the **68-95-99.7 rule** (explained below).\n",

    "- Heights of people\n",

    "## 🌟 **Key Characteristics of the Normal Distribution** (***)\n",
    "\n",
    "### 1️⃣ **Symmetry**\n",
    "The normal distribution is perfectly **symmetric** around its **mean**. This means that the left side of the curve is a mirror image of the right side.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Mean = Median = Mode**  \n",
    "In a normal distribution, the **mean** (average), **median** (middle value), and **mode** (most frequent value) are all the same.  \n",
    "This is why the peak of the curve is exactly at the center.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 🔎 **Why is symmetry important?**\n",
    "- It ensures that half of the data lies **to the left** of the mean and the other half lies **to the right**.\n",
    "- In real-life scenarios, this symmetry indicates a **balanced spread** of values.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### 2️⃣ **Bell-Shaped Curve**\n",
    "The shape of the normal distribution curve is **bell-shaped**.\n",
    "\n",
    "- The **peak** of the bell is at the **mean**.\n",
    "- The **tails** of the bell extend infinitely in both directions but never touch the x-axis (this is called the **asymptotic property**).\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### 3️⃣ **Mean and Standard Deviation Define the Curve**\n",
    "The normal distribution is uniquely defined by two parameters:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Mean (µ)**  \n",
    "   - Determines the **location** of the center of the curve.\n",
    "   - Shifts the curve **left or right** on the x-axis.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Standard Deviation (σ)**  \n",
    "   - Determines the **spread** or **width** of the curve.\n",
    "   - A **smaller σ** means the curve is **narrower** and **taller**.\n",
    "   - A **larger σ** means the curve is **wider** and **shorter**.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 4️⃣ **68-95-99.7 Rule (Empirical Rule)**\n",
    "The normal distribution follows a very important rule called the **68-95-99.7 Rule**.\n",
    "\n",
    "This rule tells us how much of the data falls within 1, 2, or 3 standard deviations from the mean:\n",

    "| ±3σ (three std devs)| 99.7%             |\n",

    "- **68%** of the data falls within **1 standard deviation** from the mean.\n",
    "- **95%** of the data falls within **2 standard deviations** from the mean.\n",
    "- **99.7%** of the data falls within **3 standard deviations** from the mean.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### 5️⃣ **Asymptotic Nature**\n",
    "The tails of the normal distribution curve are **asymptotic**, meaning:\n",
    "\n",
    "- The curve **never touches the x-axis**.\n",
    "- It **extends infinitely** in both directions.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 🔎 **Why is this important?**\n",
    "This property implies that extreme values (outliers) have a very low probability but are **never impossible**.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### 6️⃣ **Area Under the Curve = 1**\n",
    "The **total area** under the normal distribution curve is **equal to 1** (or 100%).\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 🔎 **What does this mean?**\n",
    "- The area under the curve represents **probability**.\n",
    "- Since the total area is 1, this ensures that the sum of all probabilities is **100%**.\n",
    "\n",
    "For example:\n",
    "- The area between **-1σ to +1σ** is **0.68**, meaning **68% probability**.\n",
    "- The area between **-2σ to +2σ** is **0.95**, meaning **95% probability**.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### 7️⃣ **Z-Score (Standard Score)**\n",
    "The **Z-score** tells us how many **standard deviations** a data point is from the mean.\n",

    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### 8️⃣ **Central Limit Theorem**\n",
    "The **Central Limit Theorem (CLT)** states that:\n",
    "\n",
    "> **The mean of a large number of independent random variables will tend to be normally distributed, regardless of the original distribution.**\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 🔎 **Why is CLT important?**\n",

    "4️⃣ **Mean as the inflection point**:  \n",
