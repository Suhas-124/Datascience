    "### **What is Kernel Density Estimation (KDE)?** (**)\n",
    "\n",
    "Kernel Density Estimation (KDE) is a **non-parametric way to estimate the probability density function (PDF)** of a random variable. It’s like drawing a smooth curve over a histogram to understand the underlying distribution of data.\n",
    "\n",
    "In layman's terms:\n",
    "\n",
    "- KDE helps us understand the **distribution** of continuous data by **smoothing out** the data points to create a **continuous curve**.\n",
    "- It provides a **better visualization** of the distribution compared to a histogram, which can be blocky and dependent on bin size.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## 🔍 **Why Do We Need KDE?**\n",
    "\n",
    "1️⃣ A histogram is a common way to visualize data distribution, but:\n",
    "   - The shape of the histogram depends heavily on the **bin size**.\n",
    "   - It can look different for different bin sizes, making it unreliable.\n",
    "\n",
    "2️⃣ KDE offers a **smoother and more consistent estimate** of the underlying PDF, regardless of bin size.\n",
    "\n",
    "3️⃣ KDE is especially useful when we don’t know the **exact distribution** of the data and want to estimate it from the sample.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## 🧩 **Key Concepts in KDE**\n",
    "\n",
