    "### 📊 **What is Statistics?** (***)\n",
    "\n",
    "**Statistics** is the science of collecting, organizing, analyzing, interpreting, and presenting data. It helps us make informed decisions by identifying patterns, trends, and relationships in data. In simple terms, statistics helps us convert **raw data into meaningful information**.\n",
    "\n",
    "👉 Example: A company collects sales data for the last year. Using statistics, they can determine trends, customer preferences, and forecast future sales.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## 🔍 **Types of Statistics**\n",
    "\n",
    "Statistics is broadly divided into **two main types**:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Descriptive Statistics**  \n",
    "2. **Inferential Statistics**\n",
    "\n",
    "Let’s understand both types in detail.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### 📌 **1. Descriptive Statistics**  \n",
    "\n",
    "**Descriptive Statistics** deals with summarizing and organizing data to make it easy to understand. It describes the main features of a dataset by using **charts, graphs, and summary measures**.\n",
    "\n",
    "It answers **“What does the data show?”**\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 📖 **Key Techniques in Descriptive Statistics**  \n",
    "- **Measures of Central Tendency** (Mean, Median, Mode)  \n",
    "  - **Mean:** Average value  \n",
    "  - **Median:** Middle value when data is arranged in order  \n",
    "  - **Mode:** Most frequently occurring value  \n",
    "\n",
    "- **Measures of Dispersion** (Range, Variance, Standard Deviation)  \n",
    "  - **Range:** Difference between maximum and minimum values  \n",
    "  - **Variance:** Measure of how spread out the values are  \n",
    "  - **Standard Deviation:** Square root of variance (shows data variability)\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 📊 **Visualization Tools in Descriptive Statistics**  \n",
    "- Bar charts  \n",
    "- Pie charts  \n",
    "- Histograms  \n",
    "- Box plots  \n",
    "\n",
    "#### ✅ **Example:**  \n",
    "Consider the ages of 5 students:  \n",
    "**10, 12, 14, 15, 18**  \n",
    "\n",
    "- Mean = (10 + 12 + 14 + 15 + 18) / 5 = **13.8**  \n",

    "- Range = 18 - 10 = **8**  \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### 📌 **2. Inferential Statistics**  \n",
    "\n",
    "**Inferential Statistics** helps us make predictions or draw conclusions about a **large population** based on a **sample**. It answers questions like **“What can we infer about the population based on this sample?”**\n",
    "\n",
    "It involves analyzing a sample to make **generalizations** about the population.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 📖 **Key Techniques in Inferential Statistics**  \n",
    "- **Hypothesis Testing:** Determines if a claim about a population is true  \n",
    "- **Confidence Intervals:** Range of values used to estimate the population parameter  \n",
    "- **Regression Analysis:** Examines the relationship between variables  \n",
    "- **ANOVA (Analysis of Variance):** Compares means of multiple groups  \n",
    "- **Chi-Square Test:** Tests relationships between categorical variables  \n",
    "\n",
    "#### ✅ **Example:**  \n",
    "Suppose a company wants to know the **average height of people in India**. It’s impossible to measure everyone’s height. Instead, they take a sample of **1,000 people** and calculate the average height. Using inferential statistics, they can **estimate the average height for the entire population**.\n",
