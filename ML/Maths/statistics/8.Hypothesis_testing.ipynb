    "### 🎯 **What is Hypothesis Testing?**\n",
    "\n",
    "Hypothesis testing is like being a detective for data! 🕵️‍♂️ It’s a statistical method to decide whether a claim (hypothesis) about a population is supported by sample data. Think of it as answering: **“Is there enough evidence to believe this claim?”**\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### 🌟 **Key Components of Hypothesis Testing:**\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **🎯 Null Hypothesis ($H_0$)**:  \n",
    "   - The starting assumption or default claim.  \n",
    "   - Typically states **\"no effect\"** or **\"no difference.\"**  \n",
    "   - Example: **\"The average test score is 75.\"**\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **🔍 Alternative Hypothesis ($H_a$)**:  \n",
    "   - The statement we aim to find evidence for.  \n",
    "   - Opposite of the null hypothesis.  \n",
    "   - Example: **\"The average test score is NOT 75.\"**\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **📏 Significance Level ($\\alpha$)**:  \n",
    "   - The threshold to decide if the results are statistically significant.  \n",
    "   - Common values: **5% (0.05)** or **1% (0.01).**  \n",
    "   - It’s the risk of rejecting $H_0$ when it’s actually true (Type I error).\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **📊 Test Statistic**:  \n",
    "   - A number calculated from the data.  \n",
    "   - Shows how far the sample data is from $H_0$.  \n",
    "   - Examples: **$z$-score, $t$-score.**\n",
    "\n",
    "5. **🎲 P-Value**:  \n",
    "   - The probability of observing the test results (or more extreme ones) assuming $H_0$ is true.  \n",
    "   - **Low P-value (< $\\alpha$)**: Reject $H_0$.  \n",
    "   - **High P-value (> $\\alpha$)**: Fail to reject $H_0$.\n",
    "\n",
    "6. **✅ Conclusion**:  \n",
    "   - Decide whether to reject or fail to reject $H_0$ based on the P-value.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### 🧪 **Steps in Hypothesis Testing**:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Define Hypotheses**:  \n",
    "   Example:  \n",
    "   - **$H_0$**: The average cookie weight is 50 grams. 🍪  \n",
    "   - **$H_a$**: The average cookie weight is NOT 50 grams.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Set Significance Level ($\\alpha$)**:  \n",
    "   - Example: Choose **$\\alpha = 0.05$ (5%)**.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Collect Data**:  \n",
    "   - Example: Weigh a sample of cookies (say, 30 cookies). 🍪\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Compute Test Statistic**:  \n",
    "   - Calculate how different the sample data is from $H_0$.\n",
    "\n",
    "5. **Find the P-Value**:  \n",
    "   - Use statistical software or tables to calculate the probability of the observed data.\n",
    "\n",
    "6. **Make a Decision**:  \n",
    "   - **If P-value ≤ $\\alpha$:** Reject $H_0$ 🎉  \n",
    "   - **If P-value > $\\alpha$:** Fail to reject $H_0$ 🤔  \n",
    "\n",
    "7. **Draw a Conclusion**:  \n",
    "   - Example: “The cookies likely don’t weigh 50 grams on average.”\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### 🔁 **Types of Hypothesis Tests:**\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **👉 One-Tailed Test**:  \n",
    "   Tests if a parameter is **greater than** or **less than** a certain value.  \n",
    "   Example:  \n",
    "   - $H_0$: \"Mean ≤ 75.\"  \n",
    "   - $H_a$: \"Mean > 75.\"\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **🔄 Two-Tailed Test**:  \n",
    "   Tests if a parameter is **different (either higher or lower)** from a certain value.  \n",
    "   Example:  \n",
    "   - $H_0$: \"Mean = 75.\"  \n",
    "   - $H_a$: \"Mean ≠ 75.\"\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### 🍪 **Example in Layman’s Terms: The Cookie Detective!**\n",
    "\n",
    "You claim: **\"My cookies weigh 50 grams on average.\"** A skeptical customer decides to test your claim.\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Null Hypothesis ($H_0$)**: Your claim is true (cookies weigh 50g).  \n",
    "2. **Alternative Hypothesis ($H_a$)**: Your claim is false (cookies don’t weigh 50g).  \n",
    "3. **Significance Level ($\\alpha$)**: The customer sets $\\alpha = 0.05$.  \n",
    "4. **Data Collection**: The customer weighs 30 cookies.  \n",
    "5. **Test Statistic**: A calculation based on the weights.  \n",
    "6. **P-Value**: Probability of getting these weights if $H_0$ is true.  \n",
    "7. **Conclusion**:  \n",
    "   - **If P ≤ 0.05**: The customer rejects $H_0$, saying, “Your cookies don’t weigh 50g!”  \n",
    "   - **If P > 0.05**: The customer fails to reject $H_0$, accepting the claim as plausible.\n",

    "### 🚦 **Rejection Region Approach in Hypothesis Testing**\n",
    "\n",
    "The **Rejection Region Approach** is a classic method used in hypothesis testing to decide whether to reject the null hypothesis ($H_0$). It’s like drawing a boundary on a graph 📉—if the test statistic falls in the **\"Rejection Region\"**, we reject $H_0$.  \n",
    "\n",
    "Let’s break it down step by step with a splash of color 🌈!\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### 🌟 **Key Concepts in Rejection Region Approach**\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Rejection Region** 🎯:  \n",
    "   - This is the area in the tails of the distribution where the null hypothesis ($H_0$) is unlikely to be true.  \n",
    "   - If your test statistic lands here, it’s a signal to reject $H_0$. 🚫  \n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Critical Value** 🚩:  \n",
    "   - The cutoff point(s) that define the boundary of the rejection region.  \n",
    "   - Determined based on the **significance level ($\\alpha$)**.  \n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Test Statistic** 📊:  \n",
    "   - A value calculated from the sample data.  \n",
    "   - If this value is more extreme than the critical value, it’s in the rejection region.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Decision Rule** ✅:  \n",
    "   - **If Test Statistic is in the Rejection Region:** Reject $H_0$.  \n",
    "   - **If Test Statistic is outside the Rejection Region:** Fail to reject $H_0$.  \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### 🧪 **Steps in Rejection Region Approach**\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **State the Hypotheses** 🎯:  \n",
    "   - Define $H_0$ and $H_a$ based on the problem.  \n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Choose the Significance Level ($\\alpha$)** 📏:  \n",
    "   - Example: $\\alpha = 0.05$.  \n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Determine the Critical Value(s)** 🚩:  \n",

    "\n",
    "4. **Calculate the Test Statistic** 📊:  \n",
    "   - Compute the test statistic based on the sample data.  \n",
    "\n",
    "5. **Compare Test Statistic to Critical Value(s)** 🆚:  \n",
    "   - Check if the test statistic falls within the rejection region.  \n",
    "\n",
    "6. **Make a Decision** ✅:  \n",
    "   - **In Rejection Region:** Reject $H_0$.  \n",
    "   - **Outside Rejection Region:** Fail to reject $H_0$.  \n",

A z-test helps you figure out if your measurements (sample data) agree with the bakery's claim (population data).\n",

    "**\"Do people like one brand more than the others?\"**\n",
    "\n",
    "1. 🍕 People taste pizza from **Brand A**, **Brand B**, and **Brand C**.\n",

    "## 🚦 **How ANOVA Works (The Pizza Story)**\n",
    "\n",
    "To answer this question, ANOVA checks **two things**:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **How far apart are the average scores for the brands?**  \n",
    "   (This is **Between-Group Variance**—how the brands differ.)\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **How much variation is there within each brand’s scores?**  \n",

    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### 🍕 **Key Idea**: Compare **Between-Group Variance** with **Within-Group Variance**  \n",
