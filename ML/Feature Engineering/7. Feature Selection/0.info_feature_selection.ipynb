    "# 🌟 **Spearman's Rank Correlation: The Complete Guide** 🎯\n",
    "\n",
    "### **🔹 What is Spearman’s Rank Correlation?**\n",
    "Spearman’s Rank Correlation, denoted as **Spearman's ρ (rho)**, is a **non-parametric** statistical test that measures the **monotonic** relationship between two variables.\n",
    "\n",
    "🚀 Unlike **Pearson’s correlation**, which captures **linear relationships**, Spearman’s correlation checks **whether one variable increases (or decreases) as another does, even if the relationship is not linear**.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### **🔹 When Should You Use Spearman's Correlation?**\n",
    "✅ **Your data is numerical** (continuous or ordinal).  \n",
    "✅ **Your data is NOT normally distributed**.  \n",
    "✅ **You suspect a monotonic (but possibly nonlinear) relationship**.  \n",
    "✅ **You have ranked or ordinal data** (like ratings, preferences, etc.).  \n",
    "✅ **You want a more robust alternative to Pearson's correlation** (less sensitive to outliers).\n",
    "\n",
    "🔴 **Do NOT use Spearman’s if:**\n",
    "❌ The relationship is NOT monotonic.  \n",
    "❌ You specifically need to measure a **linear** relationship (use Pearson instead).\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### **🔹 How Does Spearman’s Correlation Work?**\n",
    "Spearman’s correlation works by converting the data into **ranks** and then calculating the **Pearson correlation** on the ranks.\n",
    "\n",
    "👀 **Step-by-Step Process:**\n",
    "1️⃣ **Convert values into ranks** (smallest value gets rank 1, second smallest gets rank 2, etc.).  \n",
    "2️⃣ **Compute the difference between ranks** for each pair of data points.  \n",
    "3️⃣ **Calculate Spearman’s correlation using the formula**:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\n",
    "ρ = 1 - \\frac{6 \\sum d_i^2}{n(n^2 - 1)}\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "Where:\n",
    "- $ d_i $ = difference between the ranks of each pair\n",
    "- $ n $ = number of observations\n",
    "\n",
    "### **🔹 Spearman’s vs. Pearson’s vs. Mutual Information**\n",
    "| Method | Relationship Type | Handles Nonlinear? | Affected by Outliers? | Works with Ordinal Data? |\n",

    "### **🔹 Spearman’s Correlation in Python**\n",
    "Here’s how you can calculate Spearman’s correlation using `scipy`:\n",
