    "\n",
    "\n",
    "**XGBoost (Extreme Gradient Boosting)** is a powerful and efficient machine learning algorithm that is widely used in competitions like **Kaggle** and for real-world applications. It's known for being **fast, accurate**, and **capable of handling large datasets**.\n",

    "## üßê **Why XGBoost?**\n",
    "Imagine you're a teacher grading students. Some students are weak in math but strong in English. To get better overall performance, you could help each student improve in areas where they struggle.\n",

    "- Focuses on **fixing mistakes** made by previous models (weak learners).\n",
    "- Builds a **strong prediction model** by combining many weak models.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## üå± **What Does XGBoost Do?**\n",
    "XGBoost is a **boosting algorithm**, which means:\n",
    "1. It builds models **sequentially**.\n",
    "2. Each new model tries to **correct the errors** made by the previous models.\n",
