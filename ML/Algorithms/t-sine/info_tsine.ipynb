    "### üåê **What is t-SNE? (t-Distributed Stochastic Neighbor Embedding)**\n",
    "\n",
    "**t-SNE** is a **dimensionality reduction algorithm** that is mainly used for **visualizing high-dimensional data** in **2D or 3D** space. It is widely used in **machine learning**, especially for **clustering and pattern discovery** in complex datasets.\n",
    "\n",
    "In simple terms:\n",
    "\n",
    "üëâ **Imagine you have a dataset with hundreds of features**, and you want to visualize how the data points are related. **t-SNE helps reduce the dimensions to 2D or 3D** so that you can **see clusters, patterns, and relationships** in the data.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## üîç **Why Do We Need t-SNE?**\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Data often has many dimensions (features)**, making it hard to understand relationships between data points.\n",
    "2. **Traditional methods like PCA (Principal Component Analysis)** may not capture non-linear relationships well.\n",
    "3. **t-SNE is great for visualizing complex data** by reducing the dimensions while preserving the structure of clusters.\n",

    "---\n",

    "## üß© **How Does t-SNE Work? (Step-by-Step)**\n",
    "\n",
    "t-SNE works by:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Converting high-dimensional data into probabilities that represent similarities** between points.\n",
    "2. **Mapping those probabilities to a lower-dimensional space**, ensuring that similar points stay close and dissimilar points stay far apart.\n",
    "\n",
    "Here‚Äôs a breakdown:\n",
    "\n",
    "### **Step 1: Compute Pairwise Similarities in High-Dimensional Space**\n",
    "- For each data point, t-SNE calculates the probability that two points are **neighbors** based on their **distance**.\n",
    "- Points that are **close together** will have a **higher probability** of being neighbors.\n",
    "\n",
    "### **Step 2: Compute Pairwise Similarities in Low-Dimensional Space**\n",
    "- It randomly places the data points in a **2D or 3D space** and tries to recreate the same **neighborhood relationships** from the high-dimensional space.\n",
    "\n",
    "### **Step 3: Minimize the Difference Between High-Dimensional and Low-Dimensional Probabilities**\n",
    "- t-SNE minimizes a loss function called **KL divergence** to ensure that the structure of the data is preserved during the dimensionality reduction.\n",
