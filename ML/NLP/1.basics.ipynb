    "## 🧑‍💻 **End-to-End NLP Pipeline** 🧑‍💻\n",
    "\n",
    "### **1. Data Collection and Preprocessing** 🌍\n",
    "The first step is collecting and preprocessing the raw text data. This step is crucial because the data is often unstructured, noisy, and might require cleaning before analysis.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Steps in Data Collection & Preprocessing:\n",
    "- **Data Collection**: Collect textual data from various sources like websites, books, emails, customer reviews, social media posts, etc.\n",
    "- **Cleaning**: Remove unwanted characters, HTML tags, special symbols, and punctuation marks that aren't useful for NLP tasks.\n",
    "- **Lowercasing**: Convert all text to lowercase so that \"Apple\" and \"apple\" are treated as the same word.\n",
    "- **Removing Stopwords**: Stopwords are common words (like \"the,\" \"is,\" \"and\") that are usually removed because they don't carry significant meaning.\n",
    "- **Tokenization**: Break the text into smaller chunks, such as **tokens**, which could be words or sentences.\n",
    "  \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### **2. Text Representation** 🔠  \n",
    "Once the text is cleaned and tokenized, we need to convert it into a format that can be used by machine learning algorithms. This is done using text representation techniques.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Popular Text Representation Methods:\n",
    "- **Bag of Words (BoW)**: This method represents text by counting how many times each word appears in the document.\n",
