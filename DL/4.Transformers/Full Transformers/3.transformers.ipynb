First introduced in the paper **\"Attention Is All You Need\"** by Vaswani et al.

    "\n",
    "A **Transformer** is a neural network model that relies on a mechanism called **self-attention** to process input data **in parallel**, making it highly efficient and powerful. Unlike earlier models such as **RNNs (Recurrent Neural Networks) and LSTMs**, which process data sequentially, transformers can analyze **entire input sequences at once**, drastically improving speed and accuracy.\n",

    "# üß† **How Transformers Work? (Simplified)**\n",

    "### üîπ **Encoder (Understanding Input)**\n",
    "- Takes input (e.g., a sentence) and processes it using self-attention.\n",
    "- Captures relationships between words, even if they are far apart.\n",

    "### üîπ **Self-Attention Mechanism**\n",

    "- Assigns **attention scores** to words based on their importance.\n",

    "\n",
    "### 1Ô∏è‚É£ **BN Depends on Mini-Batch Statistics, LN Does Not!**  \n",
    "- **Batch Normalization** normalizes inputs across the **batch dimension**, meaning it relies on the statistics (mean & variance) of a batch of examples.  \n",
    "- **Layer Normalization** normalizes across the **features of a single input (token)**, making it **independent of batch size**.  \n",
    "\n",
    "üí° **Why is this important?**  \n",
    "- **In Transformers, we process a single input at inference time (e.g., one sentence at a time).** If we used Batch Norm, statistics from a single sample wouldn‚Äôt be stable, leading to inconsistent results.  \n",
    "- **Layer Norm works even when batch size = 1**, making it ideal for NLP tasks where input sizes vary.  \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### 2Ô∏è‚É£ **Batch Norm Doesn‚Äôt Work Well with Variable Sequence Lengths**  \n",
    "- **BN computes mean & variance per batch**, but **in NLP, sentence lengths vary** (e.g., \"Hello world\" vs. \"This is a long sentence\").  \n",
    "- Padding sequences in BN can distort batch statistics, making it harder to learn meaningful representations.  \n",
    "- **LN normalizes each sequence independently**, so it avoids these issues.  \n",
    "\n",
    "üí° **Why is this important?**  \n",
    "In NLP, inputs are variable-length sequences, and **BN struggles with this**. LN, however, handles it smoothly!  \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### 3Ô∏è‚É£ **BN Breaks in Autoregressive Models Like GPT**  \n",
    "- In models like **GPT (causal Transformer)**, we generate tokens **one by one** during inference.  \n",
    "- **Batch Norm requires full batches to compute statistics, but in autoregressive models, we generate one token at a time!**  \n",
    "- **Layer Norm does not depend on batches, so it works perfectly in autoregressive tasks.**  \n",
    "\n",
    "üí° **Why is this important?**  \n",
    "BN would fail when generating text token-by-token, but LN does not!  \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### 4Ô∏è‚É£ **LN Works Better for Attention Mechanisms**  \n",
    "- Transformers **use self-attention**, where each token interacts with all others in the sequence.  \n",
    "- **Batch Norm computes batch-level statistics, which can introduce unwanted interactions** between different sentences in a batch.  \n",
    "- **Layer Norm operates at the token level**, preserving the meaning of self-attention outputs.  \n",
    "\n",

    "\n",
    "Cross-attention is a crucial mechanism in **transformers**, especially in models like **encoder-decoder architectures (e.g., T5, BART, and Transformer-based Machine Translation)**. It enables the **decoder to focus on relevant encoder outputs** while generating each token of the output.\n",

    "# **üìå Why Do We Need Cross-Attention?**\n",
    "1. **Bridging Encoder and Decoder** üîó  \n",
    "   - The encoder processes the **input sequence** and generates **contextual representations**.\n",
    "   - The decoder **does not directly access the input** but must **attend** to the encoder's output to generate relevant output tokens.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Handling Contextual Dependencies** üß†  \n",
    "   - Some output tokens depend on long-distance dependencies from the input.  \n",

    "\n",
    "3. **Improving Translation & Summarization** üìù  \n",
    "   - In **machine translation**, the decoder must generate words in the target language while referring to the encoder outputs.  \n",
