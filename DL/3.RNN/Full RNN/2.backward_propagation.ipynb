    "## 🚀 **Understanding Backpropagation in RNNs**\n",
    "### 🌟 **Step 1: Forward Pass**  \n",
    "In a standard RNN, we pass input sequences **step by step** through the network while maintaining a hidden state:  \n",

    "$$\n",
    "h_t = f(W_h h_{t-1} + W_x x_t + b)\n",

    "During this process, the **hidden state carries information** forward in time, making RNNs great for sequential tasks like speech recognition and text processing.  \n",

    "### 🔄 **Step 2: Loss Calculation**  \n",
    "After the forward pass, we compute the **loss** using a function like **Mean Squared Error (MSE) or Cross-Entropy Loss**, depending on the problem (regression or classification).  \n",

    "\n",
    "Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs) are great for handling **sequential data** like **text, speech, and time series**, but they come with several limitations. Let’s break them down in a **simple, colorful way** and also discuss possible solutions! 🌈  \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## 🔥 **1. Vanishing Gradient Problem**\n",
    "### ❌ **What is it?**\n",
    "- When training an RNN with **backpropagation through time (BPTT)**, the gradients shrink **exponentially** as they are passed backward through many time steps.  \n",
    "- This means earlier layers receive **almost no updates**, making it **hard for RNNs to learn long-term dependencies**.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 📉 **Why does this happen?**\n",
    "- The chain rule in **backpropagation** involves multiplying many small values (gradients of activation functions like sigmoid or tanh), leading to values approaching **zero**.\n",
    "- This results in **\"memory loss\"** in RNNs—**they forget long-term dependencies**.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 🛠 **How to fix it?**\n",
    "✅ **Use LSTMs (Long Short-Term Memory) or GRUs (Gated Recurrent Units)** – They use special gates to store and update information efficiently.  \n",
    "✅ **Use ReLU activation instead of tanh/sigmoid** – ReLU helps prevent gradients from shrinking.  \n",
    "✅ **Use batch normalization or layer normalization** to stabilize training.  \n",
    "✅ **Gradient clipping** – Limits the gradient values to prevent them from shrinking too much.  \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## 🚀 **2. Exploding Gradient Problem**\n",
    "### ❌ **What is it?**\n",
    "- The opposite of the vanishing gradient problem!  \n",
    "- When gradients grow **too large**, they cause unstable updates, making the model diverge instead of learning.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 📈 **Why does this happen?**\n",
    "- If weights are large or initialized poorly, gradients can **explode exponentially** during backpropagation.\n",
    "- This results in sudden, erratic updates, making the network **unstable**.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 🛠 **How to fix it?**\n",
    "✅ **Gradient Clipping** – Set a threshold so that gradients don’t grow beyond a certain limit.  \n",
    "✅ **Use smaller learning rates** to prevent large weight updates.  \n",
    "✅ **Use careful weight initialization techniques** like Xavier or He initialization.  \n",

    "\n",
    "### 🛠 **How to fix it?**\n",
