    "\n",
    "RNNs are a special type of neural network designed to process **sequential data**, such as time-series data, speech, and text. Unlike traditional ANNs, RNNs have a **memory** that allows them to consider past inputs while processing current ones.\n",

    "## 🏗️ **Basic RNN Architecture**  \n",
    "\n",
    "RNNs are different from standard ANNs because they have a **feedback loop** that allows information to persist over time.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 🔹 **Structure of a Simple RNN**  \n",
    "The architecture consists of:  \n",
    "1. **Input Layer**: Takes the input sequence.  \n",
    "2. **Hidden Layer (Recurrent Neurons)**: Maintains a memory of previous states and updates at each time step.  \n",
    "3. **Output Layer**: Produces the final prediction.\n",
    "\n",
    "💡 **Key difference from ANN**: The hidden layer is connected to itself! This allows information to flow from previous time steps.\n",

    "\n",
    "### ❌ **Vanishing Gradient Problem**  \n",
    "- When training deep RNNs with many time steps, gradients shrink to near **zero** during backpropagation.  \n",
    "- This makes it **hard to learn long-term dependencies** (i.e., remembering things from many time steps ago).\n",
    "\n",
    "### ❌ **Exploding Gradient Problem**  \n",
    "- If gradients grow **too large**, they can make the training unstable.\n",

    "\n",
    "1. **One-to-One (Vanilla RNN)**\n",
    "   - Used for simple tasks like image classification.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **One-to-Many**\n",
    "   - Example: Generating music 🎵 from a single note.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Many-to-One**\n",
