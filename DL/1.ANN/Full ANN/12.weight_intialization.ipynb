    "\n",
    "Weight initialization is **crucial** in deep learning! If we start with bad weights, our network might learn too slowly, get stuck, or even explode with massive gradients. Let’s explore some **cool techniques** to set weights smartly! 🚀  \n",

    "## 1️⃣ **Zero Initialization (🚫 Bad Idea!)**  \n",
    "💡 **What is it?**  \n",
    "Set all weights to **zero**.  \n",
    "\n",
    "⚠️ **Why is it bad?**  \n",
    "- Every neuron learns the **same thing** (symmetry problem).  \n",
    "- No unique weight updates = network doesn’t learn anything useful! 🤯  \n",
    "\n",
    "📌 **Used for biases, but never for weights!**  \n",

    "💡 **What is it?**  \n",
    "Set weights randomly from a **uniform or normal distribution**.  \n",
    "\n",
    "⚠️ **Why it can go wrong?**  \n",
    "- If values are **too small**, gradients vanish (slow learning 🚶).  \n",

    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### 🏗️ What is Weight Initialization?  \n",
    "Think of training a neural network like **teaching a student**.  \n",
    "- If the student starts with **no knowledge (zero weights)**, they can’t learn properly.  \n",
    "- If the student starts with **random, chaotic knowledge (random weights)**, they might get confused.  \n",
    "- If we **give them a good starting point**, they learn faster and better.  \n",
    "\n",
    "That’s exactly what weight initialization does – it **sets the starting knowledge** of a neural network so it can learn efficiently!  \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### 🎨 Different Ways to Initialize Weights  \n",
    "\n",
    "#### 🚫 1. **Zero Initialization (Bad Idea!)**  \n",
    "Imagine a teacher giving **the same book** to every student. Everyone learns the same thing → No diversity → **No learning happens!**  \n",
    "👉 That’s why we **never** initialize all weights to zero.  \n",
    "\n",
    "#### 🎲 2. **Random Initialization (Better, but Risky!)**  \n",
    "This is like throwing books randomly at students without checking if they are too easy or too hard.  \n",
    "- **Too small weights?** The student learns **too slowly** (vanishing gradients 😴).  \n",
    "- **Too big weights?** The student gets **confused** (exploding gradients 🤯).  \n",
    "\n",
    "👉 We need a **better balance** than just random values!  \n",
    "\n",
    "#### 🎯 3. **Xavier (Glorot) Initialization (Balanced Learning!)**  \n",
    "Imagine a teacher who gives students books that are **neither too easy nor too hard**.  \n",
    "👉 **Works well for sigmoid/tanh activations** but **not for ReLU**.  \n",
    "\n",
    "#### 🔥 4. **He Initialization (Best for ReLU!)**  \n",
    "If students are learning **only from positive examples** (like ReLU), they need **more challenging books** to learn properly.  \n",
    "👉 He Initialization gives weights slightly **higher values** so the network doesn’t get stuck.  \n",
    "\n",
    "#### 🧑‍🔬 5. **Lecun Initialization (Best for Sigmoid/Tanh!)**  \n",
    "This is like giving **special books** to students who need a **gentler learning curve** (like sigmoid/tanh networks).  \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### 🏆 Which One to Use?  \n",
    "- **If using ReLU → Use He Initialization** (🔥 Works best!)  \n",
    "- **If using Sigmoid/Tanh → Use Xavier or Lecun**  \n",
    "- **Never set weights to zero!** 🚫  \n",
