    "\n",
    "In **deep learning**, the **loss function** is crucial for training the model, as it defines how far the predicted outputs are from the actual values (or true labels). The optimizer uses the loss to update the model's weights during training, guiding the model toward better performance.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## **üîπ What is a Loss Function in Deep Learning?**\n",
    "\n",
    "A **loss function** is a mathematical function that measures the **error** between the model's predictions and the actual results. The goal is to **minimize this error** during training, which is done by **adjusting the weights** of the neural network. The loss function defines **how much the model is wrong** and helps the model learn.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## **üîπ Role of Loss Function in Deep Learning**\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Guides Training:** It provides the **signal** that guides the **optimization process** during training.\n",
    "2. **Measures Performance:** The loss function is a metric that allows you to track the **performance of the model** over time.\n",
    "3. **Helps with Weight Updates:** It tells the optimizer how to adjust the **weights** to reduce the error.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## **üß† Types of Loss Functions in Deep Learning**\n",
    "\n",
    "Different loss functions are used depending on the task (regression, classification, etc.):\n",
    "\n",
    "### **1Ô∏è‚É£ Loss Functions for Regression (Continuous Values)**\n",
    "\n",
    "In **regression** problems, we aim to predict a continuous value, such as predicting house prices or stock prices. For this, we use **loss functions** that measure the difference between the predicted value and the actual value.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### **Mean Squared Error (MSE)**\n",

    "  MSE = \\frac{1}{N} \\sum_{i=1}^{N} (y_i - \\hat{y}_i)^2\n",
    "  $$\n",
    "- **Explanation:** The **MSE** calculates the average squared difference between the actual and predicted values. It's sensitive to outliers, as it **penalizes larger errors** more heavily.\n",

    "\n",
    "#### **Sparse Categorical Cross-Entropy**\n",
    "- **Formula:**  \n",
    "  Similar to **Categorical Cross-Entropy** but the labels are **integers** instead of one-hot encoded vectors.\n",
    "- **Explanation:** It is efficient for multi-class problems with large numbers of classes when labels are given as integers.\n",

    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### **3Ô∏è‚É£ Loss Functions for Object Detection and Segmentation**\n",
    "\n",
    "In **object detection** (e.g., detecting objects in images) and **segmentation** tasks (e.g., pixel-wise classification), specialized loss functions are used.\n",
    "\n",

    "  $$\n",
    "  Dice = \\frac{2 \\cdot \\text{Area of Overlap}}{\\text{Total Area}}\n",
    "  $$\n",
