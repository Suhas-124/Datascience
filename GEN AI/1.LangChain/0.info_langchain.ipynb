    "\n",
    "### 🧱 Large Language Models (LLMs) Have Token Limits!\n",
    "\n",
    "Most LLMs (like GPT-4) can only handle a certain number of **tokens** (think of tokens as word-pieces). If your document is too long, you **can't feed it in one go**—it’s like trying to fit a jumbo pizza into a mini microwave 🍕💥.\n",
    "\n",
    "That’s where **Text Splitters** come in.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## ✂️ What Do Text Splitters Do?\n",
    "\n",
    "**Text splitters break down large texts into smaller, manageable chunks** so they can be fed into LLMs piece by piece, *without losing context or meaning*.\n",
    "\n",

    "## 🔧 How Do They Work?\n",
    "\n",
    "LangChain offers several types of text splitters. Here are the popular ones:\n",
    "\n",
    "### 1. **CharacterTextSplitter** – 🔤\n",
    "Splits based on **character count**. You define:\n",
    "- `chunk_size`: how big each chunk should be (in characters)\n",
    "- `chunk_overlap`: how much content should *overlap* between chunks (helps preserve context)\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "from langchain.text_splitter import CharacterTextSplitter\n",
    "\n",

    "### 2. **RecursiveCharacterTextSplitter** – 🔄🧠\n",
    "Smart splitter! It tries to split on:\n",
    "- Paragraphs → then\n",
    "- Sentences → then\n",

    "### 🌟 What are **Vector Stores** in LangChain?\n",
    "\n",
    "Imagine you're a **librarian**, but instead of sorting books by **title** or **author**, you're sorting **ideas**, **meanings**, or **concepts**. Sounds futuristic, right? 🚀  \n",
    "That’s exactly what **Vector Stores** do in **LangChain**.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### 📦 Real-Life Analogy:  \n",
    "Think of a **vector store** like a **magic filing cabinet** 📁✨.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Each **document**, **text chunk**, or **knowledge snippet** gets turned into a **vector** — a long list of numbers 🧮.\n",
    "- These vectors don’t just store text, they store **meaning**!\n",
    "- So when you ask a question, LangChain doesn't look for **exact matches** — it searches for **semantically similar** content 🔍🧠.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### 🧱 How it works step-by-step:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **You add data** → e.g., FAQs, articles, transcripts 📝  \n",
    "2. LangChain uses an **embedding model** (like OpenAI or Hugging Face) to convert each piece into a vector 📊  \n",
    "3. These vectors go into a **vector store** like:\n",
    "   - **FAISS** (fast & lightweight ⚡)\n",
    "   - **Pinecone** (cloud & scalable ☁️)\n",
    "   - **Chroma**, **Weaviate**, **Qdrant**, and more! 🧰\n",
    "4. When a user asks a question 🤔, LangChain:\n",
    "   - Converts that question into a vector too ➡️📈\n",
    "   - Compares it to all the vectors in the store\n",
    "   - Returns the **most similar** ones — as if it found the most relevant \"pages\" 📚✨\n",

    "## 🔍 What are Retrievers in LangChain?\n",
    "\n",
    "**Retrievers** are components in LangChain that help **fetch relevant information (documents or data chunks)** from a **knowledge base**, based on a user's query. \n",
    "\n",
    "> Think of retrievers as the \"search engine\" inside your AI application — they don't generate answers themselves but provide the **most relevant data** that the LLM can use to generate a response.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## 💡 Why Are Retrievers Needed?\n",
    "\n",
    "When you're building an app like:\n",
    "- A **chatbot for documentation**\n",
    "- A **support assistant with PDFs**\n",
    "- A **Q&A bot using internal data**\n",
    "\n",
    "You **can’t fit all your documents into the prompt** because of token limits. Instead:\n",
    "1. Store all documents (as chunks) in a **vector store**.\n",
    "2. Use a **retriever** to fetch the top relevant chunks for any query.\n",
    "3. Pass only those to the LLM (like GPT) for generating answers.\n",
    "\n",
    "This is the essence of **Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)**.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## 🔧 How Do Retrievers Work?\n",
    "\n",
    "### Step-by-step:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Ingest documents**: Break documents into smaller chunks using a **text splitter**.\n",
    "2. **Embed documents**: Use an **embedding model** (like OpenAI, HuggingFace, etc.) to convert text chunks into vectors.\n",
    "3. **Store embeddings**: Save them in a **vector store** like FAISS, Chroma, Pinecone, Weaviate, etc.\n",
    "4. **Retriever**: \n",
    "   - Converts the user query into an embedding.\n",
    "   - Finds the most **similar vector chunks** using similarity search or advanced retrieval logic.\n",
    "5. **LLM**: The relevant chunks are passed along with the user's query to generate a meaningful and accurate answer.\n",

    "## 🧱 Types of Retrievers in LangChain\n",
    "\n",
    "LangChain provides various retriever classes. Each has its own use case depending on your goal (accuracy, diversity, speed, etc.).\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### 1. **VectorStoreRetriever**\n",
    "- **Most common** and simple.\n",
    "- Uses similarity search to fetch the most relevant chunks from a vector store.\n",
    "- Ideal for standard RAG setups.\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "from langchain.vectorstores import FAISS\n",
    "from langchain.embeddings.openai import OpenAIEmbeddings\n",
    "\n",

    "retriever = vectorstore.as_retriever()\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### 2. **MMRRetriever (Max Marginal Relevance Retriever)**\n",
    "- **Smart retrieval** that balances:\n",
    "  - **Relevance to the query**\n",
    "  - **Diversity of results** (avoid redundancy)\n",
    "- Great for use cases where many chunks have similar content.\n",

    "```python\n",
    "retriever = vectorstore.as_retriever(\n",
    "    search_type=\"mmr\",\n",

    ")\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "- `k`: how many chunks to return.\n",
    "- `lambda_mult`: `0.0` = more diversity, `1.0` = more relevance.\n",
    "\n",
    "✅ Use MMR if your current retriever is returning *too many similar-looking results*.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### 3. **MultiQueryRetriever**\n",
    "- Uses the LLM to generate **multiple variations** of the query.\n",
    "- Each variation is run through the retriever, and results are combined.\n",
    "- Useful for **query expansion** and getting a broader coverage of results.\n",

    "- **Traditional keyword-based search** using TF-IDF style scoring.\n",
    "- Doesn’t use embeddings — fast and interpretable.\n",
