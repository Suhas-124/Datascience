Chimpanzees (**Pan troglodytes**) are one of the closest living relatives to humans, sharing nearly **98.7%** of their DNA with us. They are **highly intelligent primates** known for their complex social behaviors, problem-solving abilities, and tool usage. Found in the forests and savannahs of **Central and West Africa**, chimpanzees are adaptable and thrive in a variety of environments.

### 🏞 **Habitat & Distribution**
Chimpanzees primarily inhabit **rainforests, woodlands, and savannahs** across **21 African countries**. They build **nests in trees** for sleeping and spend most of their time climbing, foraging, and interacting in groups.

### 🍌 **Diet & Feeding Habits**
Chimpanzees are **omnivorous**, meaning they eat both plants and animals. Their diet consists of **fruits, leaves, nuts, seeds, honey, insects**, and occasionally **small mammals**. They have been observed using tools like **sticks to extract termites** or **stones to crack nuts**, showcasing their intelligence.

### 🏡 **Social Structure & Behavior**
Chimpanzees live in **complex social groups** called **communities** or **troops**, which can range from **20 to 100 individuals**. They communicate through **facial expressions, vocalizations, and gestures**. **Grooming** is an essential social activity that strengthens bonds and reduces tension within the group.

### 🧠 **Intelligence & Tool Use**
Chimpanzees are among the most intelligent animals on Earth. They **use and modify tools**, learn from observation, and even exhibit **problem-solving skills**. Studies have shown that they can recognize themselves in mirrors, a sign of **self-awareness**.

### ❤️ **Emotions & Relationships**
Chimpanzees display a **wide range of emotions**, including **joy, sadness, anger, and grief**. Mothers form strong bonds with their infants, caring for them for **several years**. They have also been observed **mourning the loss** of group members.

### ⏳ **Lifespan & Threats**
In the wild, chimpanzees can live up to **40–50 years**, while in captivity, they may reach **60 years**. Unfortunately, their populations are declining due to **habitat destruction, poaching, and disease**. Conservation efforts are crucial to protecting them.

### 🌍 **Conservation Status**
Chimpanzees are classified as **endangered** by the **IUCN Red List**. Organizations like the **Jane Goodall Institute** and the **World Wildlife Fund (WWF)** are actively working to protect their habitats and promote conservation efforts.

Chimpanzees are **remarkable creatures** that continue to amaze researchers with their intelligence, emotions, and social complexity. Studying them provides valuable insights into both animal behavior and human evolution. 🐵🌍
